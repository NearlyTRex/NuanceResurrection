Compatibility Level:
====================

Space Invaders XL
-----------------
Playable, BUT rarely hangs in Battle Mode and Time Attack.

The Next Tetris
-----------------
Playable, distorted music.

Merlin Racing
-------------
Playable, BUT some screen corruption when watching the Adventure intro, 
and minor gfx glitches during the race.
And most noticeably: AI karts are driving around more or less randomly.

Tempest 3000
------------
Playable, BUT
1) hangs most of the time when starting a game from certain levels (level 1 as prominent example).
   WORKAROUND enter options->music test before, and play a different music track (or disable AudioInterrupts in nuance.cfg :/ )
2) hangs (only if dynamic compilation enabled) on entering level select
   WORKAROUND enter options->vector test before
(so best is to do 1) and 2) first before starting the game at all)
Also music does not loop correctly.

Ballistic
---------
Close to perfect.

Freefall 3050 AD
----------------
Unplayable.  Will require MPEG playback.
